<h1>Personal Library Management System</h1>
<p>This is a simple console-based Personal Library Management System built using C++.Core functionalities include inserting books, deleting books, displaying the book list, and searching for books by title.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The Personal Library Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ to organize and manage book records efficiently. The system demonstrates the practical application of core data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Each structure handles specific operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying data. The array and linked list store the main book database, while stacks and queues are used to simulate reading progress and reading history. All operations are accessible via a text-based menu system, ensuring clarity and ease of use. The project highlights how choosing the appropriate data structure can improve functionality, execution speed, and memory usage. The system offers a foundational example of real-world use of data structures in personal organization systems.</p>
